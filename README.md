# Pixel-Swapping-Brute-Force
This program takes advantage of a major flaw in my previous Pixel Swapping project, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. It tests all possible combinations to decrypt the image. Users can also store each attempt in separate folders, making it easier to identify the correct decryption key.
